# World Airplane Crashes Analysis(1908-2009)
Cleaning and Analyzing data in Power query and Power BI

## Introduction
This project is my capstone project for #30daysoflearning organized by [Olanrewaju Oyinbooke](https://github.com/theoyinbooke).
I analyzed a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908) about airplane crashes and fatalities around the world from a period of 1908-2009.
The dataset contained 5248 cases of crash with information about when it occurred, number of people abroad, fatalities, location and its operator/airline.

## Data Cleaning 
I imported my data into power query in excel. Then I checked for duplicates. Also used column distribution, quality and profiling to understand the validity of the data. I removed columns not neccessary for my analysis.
I also made sure my columns were in the right data type.
